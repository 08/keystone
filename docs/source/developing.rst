Developing with Keystone
========================

Contributing Code
=================

To contribute code, sign up for a Launchpad account and sign a contributor license agreement,
available on the `<http://wiki.openstack.org/CLA>`_. Once the CLA is signed you 
can contribute code through the Gerrit version control system which is related to your Launchpad account.

To contribute tests, docs, code, etc, refer to our `Gerrit-Jenkins-Github Workflow`_.

.. _`Gerrit-Jenkins-Github Workflow`: http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritJenkinsGithub

Setup
-----

Get your development environment set up according to :doc:`setup`. The instructions from here will
assume that you have installed keystone into a virtualenv. If you chose not to, simply exclude "tools/with_venv.sh" from the example commands below.

Running Keystone
----------------

To run the keystone Admin and API server instances, use::

    $ tools/with_venv.sh bin/keystone
	
this runs keystone with the configuration the etc/ directory of the project. See :doc:`configuration` for details on how Keystone is configured.

Interacting with Keystone
-------------------------

You can interact with Keystone through the command line using :doc:`man/keystone-manage`
which allows you to establish tenants, users, etc.

You can also interact with Keystone through it's REST API. There is a python
keystone client library `python-keystoneclient`_ which interacts exclusively through
the REST API, and which keystone itself uses to provide it's command-line interface.

.. _`python-keystoneclient`: https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient

Running Tests
=============

To run the full suites of tests maintained within Keystone, run::

    $ ./run_tests.sh

This shows realtime feedback during test execution, iterates over
multiple configuration variations, and uses external projects to do
light integration testing to verify the keystone API against other projects.

Test Structure

Testing Schema Migrations
-------------------------

The application of schema migrations can be tested using SQLAlchemy Migrateâ€™s built-in test runner, one migration at a time.

.. WARNING::

    This may leave your database in an inconsistent state; attempt this in non-production environments only!

This is useful for testing the *next* migration in sequence (both forward & backward) in a database under version control::

    python keystone/common/sql/migrate_repo/manage.py test \
	--url=sqlite:///test.db \
	--repository=keystone/common/sql/migrate_repo/

This command references to a SQLite database (test.db) to be used. Depending on the migration, this command alone does not make assertions as to the integrity of your data during migration.

Writing Tests
-------------

Further Testing
---------------

devstack_ is the *best* way to quickly deploy keystone with the rest of the
OpenStack universe and should be critical step in your development workflow!

You may also be interested in either the `OpenStack Continuous Integration Project`_
or the `OpenStack Integration Testing Project`_.

Building the Documentation
==========================

The documentation is all generated with Sphinx from within the docs directory.
To generate the full set of HTML documentation:

    cd docs
    make autodoc
    make html
    make man

the results are in the docs/build/html and docs/build/man directories
respectively.
